# Snake

Welcome to snake! It works pretty well, but there are some bugs and some opportunities to make it better!

## Fix Bugs
1. The apple is the same color as the snake. Change the apple's color to be red.
2. The right key doesn't work to make the snake turn right.
3. We are supposed to be able to press the spacebar to start a new game, but it isn't working
4. The high score is incorrectly updated after every game, regardless of whether it is actually higher than the previous high score.


## New feature ideas
1. Change the colors of the characters to make it look cooler.
2. Add multiple positions for the apple (instead of just one)
3. Add random walls to the middle of the board that the snake has to avoid.
4. Add a Pause option. If the user presses "p" for pause, the game pauses.
5. Add a `candy` character the snake should avoid. Eating it does not add to the score and grow the snake, instead it makes the game go faster (makes the delay between each turn slightly less).
6. Add a `bomb` character that appears in a random location and "explodes" (effecting each square touching it) after a random amount of turns. If the snake head hits the bomb or explosion the game ends. After an explosion the bomb is removed for a random ammount of turns and then appears again.
